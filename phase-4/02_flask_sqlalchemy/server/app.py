# 17.âœ… Request Hooks
# @app.before_request: runs a function before each request.
# @app.before_first_request: runs a function before the first request (but not subsequent requests).
# @app.after_request: runs a function after each request.
# @app.teardown_request: runs a function after each request, even if an error has occurred.
# Functions marked with before_request() are called before a request and passed no arguments. Functions marked with after_request() are called after a request and passed the response that will be sent to the client. They have to return that response object or a different one. They are however not guaranteed to be executed if an exception is raised, this is where functions marked with teardown_request() come in. They get called after the response has been constructed. They are not allowed to modify the request, and their return values are ignored. If an exception occurred while the request was being processed, it is passed to each function; otherwise, None is passed in.
