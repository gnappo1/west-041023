pet_mood = "Hungry!"
pet_name = "Rose"

#TODO 1. âœ… Create a condition to check a pet's mood
    # If "pet_mood" is "Hungry!", "Rose needs to be fed."
    # If "pet_mood" is "Rowdy!", "Rose needs a walk."
    # In all other cases, "Rose is all good."

    # Note => Feel free to set your own values for "pet_mood" to view various outputs.

#TODO 2. âœ… Create a ternary operator using "pet_mood" as a condition:
    # If pet_food is "Hungry!" => "Rose needs to be fed."
    # In all other cases => "Rose is all good."

#TODO 3. âœ… Create a function (say_hello) that returns the string "Hello, world!"
    # Test invocation of "say_hello" in ipdb using "say_hello()"
    # say_hello() => "Hello, world!"

#TODO 4. âœ… Create a function (pet_greeting) that will return a string with interpolated pet's name
    # Test invocation of "pet_greeting" in ipdb using "pet_greeting()"
    # pet_greeting("Rose") => "Rose says hello!"
    # pet_greeting("Spot") => "Spot says hello!"

#TODO 5. âœ… Move conditional logic from Deliverable 1 into a function (pet_status) so that we may use it with different pets / moods
    # Test invocation of "pet_status" in ipdb using "pet_status(pet_name, pet_mood)"
    # pet_status("Rose", "Hungry!") => "Rose needs to be fed."
    # pet_greeting("Spot", "Rowdy!") => "Spot needs a walk."
    # pet_greeting("Bud", "Relaxed") => "Bud is all good."
    
    # Take a moment to note that "pet_name" and "pet_mood" parameters are within Local Scope and take priority over "pet_name" and "pet_mood"
    # in Global Scope.

#TODO 6. âœ… Create a function (pet_birthday) that will increment a pet's age up by 1. Use try / except to handle errors. 
    # If our function is given an incorrect datatype, it should handle the TypeError exception and alert the user
    # pet_birthday(10) => "Happy Birthday! Your pet is now 11."
    # pet_birthday("oops") => "Type Error Occurred"

# ipdb.set_trace()
